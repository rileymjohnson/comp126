# Comp 126 Final: OCRCC Redesign

This is my comp 126 final project. I'm including build directions here.
### Running the app
the app uses yarn (or you could use npm), so run `yarn` or `npm install` within the main folder to install the dependencies. This installs the backend dependencies; the front end scripts / styles are already included in the repo. After that, run the app with `yarn start` or `npm start`. The default port it will run on is `5000`, but this can be changed with an environment variable (i.e. `export PORT=3000`).

### Tech used
- ExpressJS (web server)
- pm2 (process manager on server)
- Nginx (reverse proxy on server)
- Jquery (front-end utility)
- MDBootstrap (front-end CSS framework)
- Some other random CSS / JS libraries
- 
### Yay!!!
